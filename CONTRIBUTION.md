Follow the instructions in README.md or relevant setup notebooks (Week1/Week2) to:

Prepare your environment (Python + TensorFlow/Keras)

Load the dataset correctly using the given structure

Run the notebook or main scripts for model training or prediction

🌿 Create a New Branch
bash
Copy
Edit
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
✏️ Make Your Changes
Ensure your changes are tested locally before submitting.

Maintain modular structure of model code (e.g., dataset loading, preprocessing, evaluation).

Document your code where necessary.

If working on UI (Gradio/Streamlit), preserve layout consistency.

✅ Commit Your Changes
bash
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Add: your feature description"
📤 Push and Create a Pull Request
bash
Copy
Edit
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
Go to GitHub and open a Pull Request (PR) targeting the main branch.

Link the PR to the relevant issue if applicable.

Add a brief explanation of what you've changed or added.

🌟 Contributor Tips
Use meaningful variable names and follow PEP-8 standards.
