## üß≠ Why This Project?

Every piece of garbage matters.  
Improper sorting leads to overflowing landfills and wasted recyclables.  
This project brings **machine learning** to the front lines of sustainability, helping automate and **simplify waste classification**.

üß† Built during the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship (June‚ÄìJuly 2025)**.

## üîç What Can It Detect?

The AI model classifies any uploaded garbage image into:

| Category   | Example Items               |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| üü´ Cardboard | Boxes, cartons               |
| üü° Plastic   | Bottles, containers          |
| üì∞ Paper     | Newspapers, wrappers         |
| üî© Metal     | Cans, utensils               |
| üü¢ Glass     | Jars, shattered pieces       |
| üóëÔ∏è Trash     | Everything else non-recyclable |
