# 🗑️ Garbage Classification with Transfer Learning

This project was developed during the **Shell-Edunet Skills4Future Internship (June–July 2025)**. It aims to classify garbage images into six categories using deep learning and transfer learning, achieving up to **98% accuracy**.

## 🧠 Objective
Automatically classify garbage into:
- Cardboard
- Glass
- Metal
- Paper
- Plastic
- Trash

## 🗃️ Dataset
- Folder: `TrashType_Image_Dataset`
- Loaded via `ImageDataGenerator` with train/validation split
- Includes preprocessing and augmentation for better generalization

## 🧪 Model Details
- **Base Models**: EfficientNetV2B2 (primary), MobileNetV2 (for comparison)
- **Framework**: TensorFlow / Keras
- **Accuracy Achieved**: ✅ **98%**
